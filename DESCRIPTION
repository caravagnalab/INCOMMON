Description: INCOMMON is a tool for the INference of COpy number and Mutation Multiplicity in ONcology. 
            INCOMMON infers the copy number and multiplicity of somatic mutations from tumour-only read count data, 
            and can be applied to classify mutations from large-size datasets in an efficient and fast way.
            Mutations are classified as either Tier-1 (present in 100% cells) without copy-number alterations 
            (heterozygous mutant diploid HMD), with loss of heterozygosity (LOH), copy-neutral LOH (CNLOH), amplification (AM), 
            or Tier-2 (subclonal or with high ploidy and low multiplicity).
