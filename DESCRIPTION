Description: TAPACLOTH is a tool that classifies somatic mutation calls from
    targeted-panel sequencing as either subclonal, clonal heterozygous or clonal 
    LOH thorugh a statistical hypothesis test based on a Binomial or Beta-Binomial 
    modelling of the sequencing read count process. As an additional feature, 
    TAPACLOTH can be used to infer sample purity.
