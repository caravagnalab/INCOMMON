The goal of TAPACLOTH is to classify somatic mutations from targeted panel sequencing
as subclonal, clonal heterozygous or clonal LOH.

## Installation

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("caravagnalab/TAPACLOTH")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r}
library(TAPACLOTH)
## basic example code
x = dplyr::tibble(sample = "test",
           gene = "test gene",
           nv = 50,
           dp = 100,
           vaf = 0.5,
           purity = 1
)

analyse_sample(
  data = x,
  sample_name = "test",
  alpha_level = 1e-3,
  model = "BetaBinomial",
  rho = 0.01
)
```
