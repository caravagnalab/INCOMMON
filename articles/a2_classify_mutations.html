<p>In this vignette, we classify mutations from a single sample of the
MSK-MetTropsim dataset provided within the package.</p>
<div class="section level2">

<p>The minimal input for INCOMMON analyses consists of two pieces.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="genomic-data">2.1.1 Genomic data<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#genomic-data"></a>
</h3>
<p>First we need a table of <code>genomic_data</code> (mutations) with
required columns <code>chr</code>, <code>from</code>, <code>to</code>,
<code>ref</code>, <code>alt</code>, <code>DP</code>, <code>NV</code>,
<code>VAF</code>, and <code>gene</code>.</p>
<p>The following example is taken from the internal dataset obtained
from the MSK-MetTropism cohort:</p>

<p>Second, we need a table of clinical data with at least the columns
<code>sample</code> (sample names matching the ones in

the sample, required for using tumour-specific priors. The following
example is taken from the internal dataset obtained from the
MSK-MetTropism cohort:</p>

<p>By inspecting the clinical data table, we can see that this is a
sample of a metastatic lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), with purity 0.6,
sequenced through the MSK-IMPACT targeted panel version 341.</p>
<p>The genomic data table contains 4 mutations affecting KRAS, TP53,
STK11 and SMARCA4 genes.</p>

<h3 id="initialisation-of-the-input">2.2.1 Initialisation of the input<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#initialisation-of-the-input"></a>
</h3>
<p>The first thing to do is to initialise the input so that we will have
it in INCOMMON format, through function <code>init</code>. This function
takes as input the tables of <code>genomic_data</code> and
<code>clinical_data</code>, plus optionally, a list of gene roles.</p>
<p>INCOMMON provides a default list <code>cancer_gene_census</code>
obtained from the COSMIC Cancer Gene Census v.98. The required format is
as following:</p>

<p>All the requirements for INCOMMON classification are satisfied. The
average sequencing depth is 380. Mutations flagged are PASS are the ones
that satisfy the requirements for INCOMMON classification: available,
non-negative sample purity, integer sequencing depth and number of reads
with the variant, character gene names etc. In this sample, all 4
mutations have all the required information.</p>
